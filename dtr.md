* What does each group member hope to get out of the project? What are your goals and expectations for the project?

> Deb: Would like to re-orient into the program after a module off. Changing her workflow approach to have more initiative and hands-on time.

> Charlie: Would like to pick up something completely new. Feels comfortable in Rails so far. Wants to manage time effectively to have time for advanced extensions later.

> Ryan: Wants to take a greater role in leadership, and learn to read others' needs better.

> Jen: Hopes to get a more solid rails foundation, as well as more practice with SQL and models. Would also like to be able to implement new and fun things into the project.

* When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed?

> Plan to work Mon-Thur until at least 6pm, with discussions about staying later if necessary. Friday will be a personal work day with a stand-up meeting before taking off for the day and Saturday will be a full workday. Sunday will be variable based on amount of remaining tasks. Deb will also have some commitments to various pairing sessions throughout the project. Jen needs to a definitive answer on when the day is done in order to schedule rides home.

* How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?

> Most communication will be handled via Slack and in-person. Stand-up meetings will be held at the beginning and end of the work session to catch all team members up on project status.

* What is each group member’s self-identified strength(s) technically? What does each group member want to improve on technically? How can the team assist with these improvements?

> Deb would like to improve her workflow in Git and her familiarity / comfort with Rails.

> Charlie feels strong in general logic and problem solving but would like to improve on managing the MVC stack and placing things at the correct logic level.

> Ryan feels quite confident in his skills in Rails, but would like to improve upon team leadership and workflow as well as advanced refactoring techniques.

> Jen feels fairly strong in the MVC model and knowing where information should and shouldn’t be.
She wants to be more confident in models and model level testing.

* Which feature(s) does each group member want to work on? Which feature(s) does each group member not want to work on?

> Deb wants to work on CRUD and general Rails testing. She would like to take a back-seat role on styling.

> Ryan wants to work on accomplishing the basic tasks efficiently in order to have time work on additional technologies later for extensions. Would like to step back on styling as well.

> Charlie would like to improve his skills on styling with support from the team as a whole.\

> Jen would like to gain a wide range of experience, but is not sure what specifically she would like to work on as she is not aware of whats completely available in the project.

* What is the agreed upon Git workflow? What project management tool will be used? What is the agreed upon procedure for conducting code reviews before merging into master: who will review pull requests, and when?

> Will implement a Master/Dev/Feature workflow. Feature branches should be short, one-off tasks rather than large over-arching iterations. Code will be auto-deployed to a staging and a production environment based on pushes to relevant branches.

* What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?

> Ask for help when necessary. Keep up honest and communicative feedback. If stuck on something longer than 20 mins with zero headway, ask for help. If that fails, reach out to mod 4. If none of these things help, message Nate or Josh.

* How does each group member want feedback (both positive and constructive) to be delivered?

> Professional feedback that is constructive and to the point. Be honest, kind, and respectful. Address things immediately rather than let them stew.

* Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?

> Charlie typically works almost exclusively at Turing. Still available on Slack, but probably not up for actual work.

> Ryan tends to enjoy having sprints of solo work when possible.
